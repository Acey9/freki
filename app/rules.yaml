# drop -- drops everything
# logging_tcp -- establishes a connection (3 way handshake), attempts to read X bytes, then closes the connnection. log everything
# ignore -- simply mark the packets as accepted
# spoof-- pretend to be something else. could come in multiple flavors like http or telnet
# rewrite -- rewrite the destination port to target a 3rd party honeypot. we would need to expose the original source port via an api such that the external process could log it.
# proxy -- this is slightly different from rewrite in that we could proxy the connection to an off-box addr (i.e. google.com)
